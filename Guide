Step 1. Choose the standard crayons you wish to cover (Guide v1.0 provided for <=48)
Step 2. Remove labels on crayons (can use soap and water bath overnight)
Step 3. Create labels by modifying .pdf of labels wtih the names of the microbes based on the ColorKey.
Step 4. Cut out labels.
Step 5. Apply glue stick glue to labels and wrap around crayons.

Going Further:
1. Ask students to categorize the microbe crayons based on functional groups: Which produce antimicrobials, which are known human or plant pathogens? Which are associated with plants?
2. Ask students to draw a simple cartoon with the microbe in question of an application of this microbe: e.g. sake production, antibiotic production, biomining, etc.
3. Ask students to find out more information on what the pigment is that this microbe produces. Have them draw the chemical formula.
4. Ask students to find other microbes that produce that color. Look for direct pigment production and indirect (e.g. this microbe is in the ocean, so is marine blue)
5. Many microbes produce different colors when grown under different conditions. Have students create their own crayons and describe when each color would appear. This is particularly useful for differential and selective media lessons.
